# Improving public health through action-oriented information

Our **mission** is to provide timely and high-quality information needed for decision-making, planning and evaluating vaccine and prescription drug programs by:

- conducting collaborative interdisciplinary research on uptake, safety and effectiveness of the vaccines and drugs used in Manitoba;  

- carrying out mathematical modeling and cost-effectiveness studies; 

- conducting disease burden and trend studies necessary for planning the introduction of new vaccines; and 

- performing ad hoc investigations of vaccine and drug adverse events.
