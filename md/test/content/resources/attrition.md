We created the Stata attrition command as published in the [Stata Journal](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0527). 
A user can directly create an attrition diagram, as well as maintaining an inclusion variable, using this command.
The diagram and inclusion variable are kept up-to-date, if included in the source code, without manual commands.

Enter `net install st0527` on the Stata command line to install this package and `help attrition` once installed for instructions on use.
