+++

Virtual Studio Code is a text editor for use with source code.
We created an extension to support syntax highlighting for SAS code.
The extension can be directly installed from within Virtual Studio code, or downloaded from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VaccineAndDrugEvaluationCentre.sas).
