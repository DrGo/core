We congratulate VDEC founding director Dr. Salah Mahmud on his election as a member of the Royal Society of Canada’s (RSC) College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists. Election to the Royal Society is the highest honor a Canadian academic can achieve! The distinction takes into account an academics contribution to society, their interdisciplinary approaches to research and novel contributions made in their field. Dr. Mahmud’s RSC citation and the 2017 cohort of newly elected members are found [here](http://www.rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/College Citations 2017.pdf?utm_source=2017+College+Member+Press+Release&utm_campaign=LAST+Reminder+NF+Ballots&utm_medium=email).
