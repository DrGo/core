Several epidemiological studies have found an association between maternal antibiotics use during pregnancy and increased risk of certain cancer types, although conclusions differ between studies. We examined this association in a cohort study including 262,116 mother‚Äêchild pairs of Manitoba births between 1996 and 2013. We published our results in [Cancer Medicine](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.uml.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1002/cam4.2412).
