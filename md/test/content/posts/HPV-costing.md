The total direct cost of screening and treating all human papillomavirus-related diseases (HPV-RD) has not been measured in a single study. Accurate cost estimates are needed to inform decisions on intervention priorities and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of existing programs. We used province-wide clinical, administrative, and accounting databases to measure direct medical costs of HPV infection in Manitoba (Canada). We published the results of our study in [Applied Health Economics and Health Policy](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-017-0367-1).
