Non‐Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a group of cancers with highly heterogeneous biology and clinical features. Statins are increasingly prescribed to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Early evidence shows a preventive effect of statins for some cancers, but their effect on NHL risk is unclear. Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between diabetes and increased risk of NHL, but the effect of diabetic treatment drugs such as metformin on the risk is unknown. We conducted population‐based nested case–control studies to study the effect of both drugs and published the results in the [International Journal of Cancer](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.31373) and [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0012).
