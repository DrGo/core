Despite yearly decreases in HIV prevalence and transmission due to increased education, condom use, and treatment the HIV epidemic in India remains the third largest in the world. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provides a promising new HIV intervention to reduce HIV infection rates among high-risk populations. VDEC director Dr. Salah Mahmud is collaborating on the India PrEP trial, which seeks to examine the feasibility and impact of providing PrEP along with current preventative measures to female sex workers who are at high risk of HIV infection.

Daily oral doses of prophylactic antiviral medication have been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by more than 90%. The intervention will provide an additional tool for HIV prevention but also increases interaction between those at risk and the medical community enhancing ongoing clinical monitoring that facilitates quality care and support service utilization.
