 Influenza is particularly dangerous in the elderly. However, the elderly often have a reduced response to vaccine complicating control of the flu in this vulnerable group. Our recent publication compared the efficiency of both high and low-dose influenza vaccine in people > 65 years old finding that patients receiving high-dose vaccine had a significant reduction in the risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.

  In comparison to the standard vaccine dose, the high-dose flu shot was well-tolerated in elderly adults, induced stronger immune responses and was better at preventing influenza infections than the standard-dose vaccine.  The improved response to the high-dose vaccine and its ability to prevent Flu in people over 65 years old indicates that it should be considered for inclusion in influenza immunization programs.
