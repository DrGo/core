 Lymphoma is a group of cancers originating within the immune system when cells that normally fight infection undergo changes resulting in their uncontrolled expansion. The type of lymphoma that develops depends on the cell type in which the changes occur. We recently published a study examining 30-year time trends (1984-2014) in adult lymphoma incidence, mortality and relative survival in Manitoba, Canada.

 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence was stable during the study period whereas non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) incidence rose by 4% annually until 2000, with the trend varying by sex and NHL type. HL mortality has been in decline for three decades while NHL mortality increased until 1998 in men, and until 2001 in women, with mortality declining thereafter. Age-standardised 5-year relative survival for HL increased from 72.6% in 1984–1993 to 85.8% in 2004–2013 and for NHL from 57.0% in 1984–1993 to 67.5% in 2004–2013.
