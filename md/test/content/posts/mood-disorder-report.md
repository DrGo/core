Mood (affective) disorders are group of common mental illnesses characterized by disturbance in mood and affect. They include disorders of depressed mood (e.g., major depressive disorder or depression) as well as disorders of elevated and mixed mood such as bipolar disorder. We studied mood disorders in our report: [The epidemiology, outcomes and social and economic burden of mood disorders in Manitoba: A data-linkage retrospective cohort study](/documents/Final-report-mood-disorders-v1.1.1.pdf)
