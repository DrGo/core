Dr. Righolt leads the Analytics team at VDEC. He is a data scientist, epidemiologist, and assistant professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences. He has an engineering background (PhD, Delft University of Technology; PostDoc, University of Manitoba) and experience in machine learning, statistics, big data and quantitative health research methods. He has worked on computer vision (a rapidly evolving field combining artificial intelligence and machine learning) to process and analyze the morphology of cancer cells. He quantified and classified the progressive change of super-resolution DNA structure in Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells (a method subsequently used to study other cancers and Alzheimer’s) and various other image analysis tools.

At the Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, he has worked on over 20 projects combining advanced epidemiologic methods and machine learning/deep learning to analyze massive, complex, population-based health datasets. He has published 2 book chapters and [over 30 peer-reviewed journal publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=yueSP9wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and made over 30 conference talks/poster presentations to topics ranging from effectiveness of the HPV against cervical dysplasia to the association between perioperative vaccination in cancer patients and metastasis.
