Dr. Ye’s research on cancer epidemiology focuses on hematological cancers. Currently he is studying the time and spatial trends of lymphomas and the role of common drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, statins, and metformin) in lymphoma and leukemia risk and survivorship, using Manitoba's administrative data. His previous work has examined single nucleotide polymorphisms related to lymphoma and leukemia risk. He is also interested in early life exposures to environmental pollutants, tobacco, vaccine, and drugs as they relate to childhood hematological cancer risk. 

Previously, Dr. Ye studied the impacts of environmental exposures (e.g., lead, mercury, benzene, pesticides, bisphenol A, phthalates, etc.) on child neurodevelopment and cancer risk. As B.C.'s Provincial Epidemiologist, he leads a team of analysts and epidemiologists to support the Provincial Health Officer’s mandate of monitoring, promoting, and protecting population health in B.C.
